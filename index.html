		<!-- # Inline css
			1.change the bg color
			2.change font color of h1
			3.text allignment in centre
			4. increase h1 font size


			above example was on lnline css but its not efficient way becz we have to make changes in every single line
			for decorate it
			so we use internal css

		<!-- 
			so now we used internal css suppose we create multiple web pages which related to flipkart
			and we need to syncronize all pages and we did it but in future we have to change in style 
			so then we would make changes in each web pages so this is also not reccomended so hence final 
			solution is make diiferent file for css "style.html" and link it with html file is called External css
